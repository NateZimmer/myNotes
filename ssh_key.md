### SSH Key Workflow

The following will generate a `myKey` file which is the private key that you keep on the client. Note it has no pass phrase and will also create a `myKey.pub`.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f myKey -q -N ""
```

Next, transfer append/copy the plain-text contents of `myKey.pub` to the `authorized_keys` file on the server located at `/home/[user]/.ssh`. To use this key w/ SSH, see the following 

```
ssh [server_user]@[server_ip] -p [server_port] -i myKey
```

> Note, key file permissions must be as follows:

```
sudo chmod 600 myKey
```

To transfer the key to the server, one can use the following command:

```
cat myKey.pub | (ssh [server_user]@[server_url] -p [server_port] "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys")
```

### Remote tunnel 

```
ssh -R [random port]:localhost:22 [server_user]@[server_url] -p [server_port] -i myKey
```
